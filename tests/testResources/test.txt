Ah, what we have here is a classic Opel GT, looking like a Corvette that's been shrunk in the wash. This little blue beauty thinks it's a track titan, doesn’t it? I’ll bet the owner fancies themselves as some sort of weekend racing warrior. One has to muse if they believe strapping on a number and a set of decals instantly bestows upon it the prowess of a Le Mans contender.
